Balancing the proud features of the enlarged brim with a natural tasteful look is something only American Hat Makers can accomplish. Other more relaxed brands might churn out something that is half of what our hats are, and it will show with time. You might be a month into owning some other brand's hat and you will quickly notice the flaws in their design. Whether it be stitching coming loose or color fading in a distasteful way. No matter what it is the problem won’t be the case with an American Hat Makers hat. <\/p><br><br>\n\n\n<h2>We’re Cowboy Hat Makers<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/americanhatmakers.com\/blogs\/news\/types-of-cowboy-hat-styles-and-creases-by-american-hat-makers\">Cowboy hat brim shapes<\/a> in general are a feat to tackle. Originally cowboys would shape the brims themselves giving each hat an individual taste that can be seen by regional differences in style. A Montana cowboy hat would look different than a Dallas cowboy hat. We’ve taken this concept of individuality and expressed it in all of our hats.

              "text": "<p>Sun, sweat, rain, and a poor looking outfit shouldn’t stop you from having a good day. That’s why our hats protect against all four. Our cowboy hats are UPF 100 meaning that all the harmful rays from the sun are blocked by our hats. We utilize a <a href=\"https:\/\/americanhatmakers.com\/collections\/hat-care-products\/products\/assorted-sizer-pack\">removable sweatband<\/a> on our hats allowing for versatile sizing options with our sizing inserts, meaning a hat will never be too big. As well as cleanliness in the sense that you can wash out a day’s worth of sweat from the brim of your hat. Preventing buildup of stains and bacteria. Our hats also feature a waterproof finish that helps protect the hat from liquids just as much as you. Finally all of our hats are handmade to perfection with designer quality finishes and taste. <\/p><p>A tactical cowboy hat is hard to realize but our hats have the quality and perfection that is worthy of the Army Rangers. Not to mention our<a href=\"https:\/\/americanhatmakers.com\/collections\/mens-staw-cowboy-hat\"> American straw cowboy hats<\/a>, utilizing American craftsmanship to bring you amazingly comfortable work ready straw hats. Our <a href=\"https:\/\/americanhatmakers.com\/collections\/mens-cowboy-hats\">mens cowboy hats<\/a> are like no other. We’ve tirelessly worked to imbue the spirit of the West into our hats. From crowns to brims from creases to pinches all of our hats have thought and care put into them every step of the way. A tan cowboy hat may appear to be a simple feat. But considering factors such as shading, lighting, regional dirt colors, and overall tone, just getting the right tan is a feat in and of itself. You might say to yourself, “well I’m sure a black cowboy hat is easier.” I would agree with you too, if we were the average hat company. But the black cowboy hat is a look that we sought to perfect. From the look of the distressed hat to the choice of tasteful cowhide leather, the <a href=\"https:\/\/americanhatmakers.com\/collections\/black-cowboy-hat-collection\">black leather cowboy hat<\/a> that American Hat Makers represents is challenged by no other manufacturer. From the sheens, textures, and finishes we utilize are the pinnacle of hats. Our <a href=\"https:\/\/americanhatmakers.com\/collections\/white-cowboy-hat-collection\">white leather cowboy hat<\/a> even has a sense of holy presence to it. The rolled brim cowboy hat is also a look that we’ve mastered.

With an investment of $20 in leather and $20 in leather working tools, he began making belts, wallets, and purses and selling them from the back of his 1963 Chevy station wagon. In the mid 70's, Gary created a leather hat for his own use. He loved it so much that hats quickly became his calling and sole artistic focus. <\/p><p>Mostly self-taught - while learning in the \"school of hard knocks\" - Gary is thankful for the tremendous support and advice he has received from many talented hat professinals and knowledgeable individuals over the years. He also has the good fortune to have a creative and supportive family, many of whom have chosen to join him as the demand for his handmade hats have grown.<\/p>",

But there are many factors to high quality straw from the nuances in type of straw to types of weaves.\nFor example, many people are familiar with the Panama Hat. Many people are also familiar with bubbly alcoholic beverages. What in the world do these have in common? Well just as sparkling wine is only Champagne if it’s made in Champagne France. Panama Hats aren’t real Panamas unless they’re made in Panama? \nYou’d be wrong… Real Panama Hats are only made in Ecuador. Being the leading American hat company we have to know these things. \nBut to answer the question simply Toquilla straw is the most lightweight, durable, and long lasting straw there is. A Milan straw hat is often referred to as being made from a higher quality straw. But Milan straw actually refers to the technique of how it’s weaved. To clear up hopefully the last misconception Shantung straw is made of paper fibers rather than natural ones.",

Sitting here writing this I am surrounded by mens straw sun hats, and the <a href=\"https:\/\/americanhatmakers.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">straw hats near me<\/a> are all more than suitable for UPF 50 sun protection. \nThere’s even my favorite straw pork pie hat sitting right on my desk here. I wouldn’t trade this hat for anything. The only straw hat I wouldn’t recommend for sun protection is a mens or women’s black straw hat. It would keep all of the sun out of your face but the black nature of the hat would absorb plenty of heat. Although with the right ventilation holes and the lack of mass in a straw hat it might not be that bad.\nCall us the straw hat men because when it comes to a men’s straw hat (or womens) we are the mens straw sun hats experts (or womens).",

But if you’re a part of the growing crowd of people that don't have a wire brim, you might be a little lost when it comes to getting that shape you want. \nPanic no longer, you’ve come to the central hub of everything hats. In order to reshape, or fix your <a href=\"https:\/\/americanhatmakers.com\/collections\/mens-straw-hats\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">straw hat<\/a> all you need is. A source of steam, many people use tea kettles with the lid or cap off for a more concentrated source of steam. You can even use a boiling pot of water or other steam source.\nGradually apply steam to the areas of the hat you want to rework.  Eventually you’ll feel the straw start to become more malleable. After you’ve worked it into the desired shape, simply let it dry out. \nYou’ve done it, your hat should be affixed into this position for the rest of time, and if it wanders out of shape you have every simple tool to shape it back in place. This also works if you were wondering how to shape a straw cowboy hat. That’s the secret to straw hat shaping.

In the mid 70's, Gary created a leather hat for his own use. He loved it so much that hats quickly became his calling and sole artistic focus. <\/p><p>Mostly self-taught - while learning in the \"school of hard knocks\" - Gary is thankful for the tremendous support and advice he has received from many talented hat professinals and knowledgeable individuals over the years. He also has the good fortune to have a creative and supportive family, many of whom have chosen to join him as the demand for his handmade hats have grown.<\/p>",
